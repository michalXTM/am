  <h2> CityZzz Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3> If I don't click on coins/xp/hearts/etc, will they still be added?</h3>
      <p>Yes, everything that drops is added automatically, you don't have to click on it (please note that xp and energy are added as soon as they drop, not when you click on them or when they vanishes from you screen); however clicking on those bonuses will start a &quot;bonus&quot; meter (under the xp bar) that will give you extra coins.</p>
      <img src="images/help/hud_bonus.jpg" alt="bonus" /> </li>
    <li>
      <h3>How do I gain xp?</h3>
      <p>Players can gain XP from actions completed in the game. Once an action is completed an XP doober will drop in the shape of a blue star. Collecting these doobers will increase the players XP. Note: Your XP bar will automatically fill, even without clicking on the doober.</p>
      <img src="images/help/hud_xp.jpg" alt="xp" /> </li>
    <li>
      <h3> How can a buy a new building or decoration?</h3>
      <p>Click on the &quot;Build&quot; button, navigate to the appropriate tab and purchase it, make sure you meet all the requirements to buy it (such as coins, level and neighbors). </p>
      <img src="images/help/toolbar.jpg" alt="build menu" /> </li>
    <li>
      <h3> Where can I place the new building or decoration?</h3>
      <p>Community buildings can be placed anywhere; however, Housing buildings and Businesses must be placed next to a road or a sidewalk.  Decorations can be placed anywhere, but are most useful next to businesses and houses, since they will give bonuses to rent/income.</p>
      <img src="images/help/move_house.png" alt="place building" /></li>
    <li>
      <h3> How can I start and finish the construction of a business or a house?</h3>
      <p>Once you place it in your city you will see how many clicks it will take to finish construction by hovering over the building; each click will take 1 energy.</p>
      <img src="images/help/build_house.jpg" alt="build building" /></li>
    <li>
      <h3> My new house/business is grayed out, with a red sign on top of the building, and I can't collect rent/income, what's wrong?</h3>
      <p>Make sure that the house/business is connected to a road or a sidewalk, if you think it is connected try moving it slightly to double check. If your building looks grayed out with a red sign then it is not correctly connected to a road. </p>
      <img src="images/help/not_connected.png" alt="not connected to road" /></li>
    <li>
      <h3> How do I move, rotate or delete/remove an object?</h3>
      <p>Use the arrow tool above the build button then select the desired tool.</p>
      <img src="images/help/actionbar.png" alt="action bar" /></li>
    <li>
      <h3> How often can I collect rent from a residence?</h3>
      <p>You can hover over each house in your city to find out how soon you can collect rent, or you can enter the build menu and hover over a residence to find out how often you can collect rent from that type of residence. </p>
      <img src="images/help/collect_rent.jpg" alt="collect rent" /></li>
    <li>
      <h3> How can I build a Community Building?</h3>
      <p>You can start construction on it just like any other building, hovering over the unfinished building will tell you how many clicks you still need; however,  in order to finish it you will need help from your friends (or you can purchase the required materials with city cash). You can click on the unfinished community building for a list of everything that is required to finish it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3> Can I buy more plots for my crops?</h3>
      <p>Yes, you can from the farming menu for the specified amount of coins.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3> How much energy does it cost to plant crops and to harvest crops?</h3>
      <p>It does not take energy to plant crops but it does take 1energy to harvest a crop.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3> How many goods can one crop produce? </h3>
      <p>Crops can only be harvested one time, and then need to be replanted.  The more expensive the crop is, the more goods you will receive when harvesting. You can find out how much goods a crop will produce by hovering over in the farming menu.  Currently &quot;Peas&quot; have the highest goods value.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3> How quickly do crop wither?</h3>
      <p>Except for Strawberries (which do not wither), crops wither at 2x growth time, which means that a 1 hour crop will wither 2 hours after it�s ready for harvesting (or 3 hours after being planted).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3> What do the hearts do? </h3>
      <p>Hearts increase your reputation level.  The higher your reputation level, the more XP your friends will get when they hire you for their city.  For instance, if user A reputation level is 50 and user B reputation level is 25�then hiring user A will get you more XP than if you hire user B.  In addition, hired people get paid 50 coins each time.  50 is the maximum heart level you can reach.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3> How can I get more energy?</h3>
      <p>Your energy will refill according to the timer on your energy bar, every time the timer counts down to 0 you will receive 1 energy point up to your max energy. You can also receive more energy by visiting your neighbors, as a random bonus drop for various actions, and you can purchase more energy with city cash from the &quot;Build&quot; menu. In addition, energy can be gifted from the free gifts page. When you reach the next level your energy bar will be fully refilled and your maximum energy is increased by 1.</p>

      <p>You should visit a friend with an available &quot;Empty Lot&quot; (see image below), click on the empty lot and select which business you would like to expand.  Your friend must have previously placed an empty lot on their city by selecting it from the Build Menu under the Businesses tab for 0 coins.

      <img src="images/help/franchise_declined.png" alt="franchise declined" /> </li>
    <li>
      <h3> How can I expand my city?</h3>
      <p>After you have completed the required goals, you will be able to expand your city.   In order to unlock an expansion you will need permits, which you can get from your friends or purchase with city cash.  Once you have an expansion available you can place it to expand your city.

    <li>
      <h3>What do I get from completing a collection?</h3>
