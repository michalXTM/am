    str: "For campfires and camaraderie, no getaway beats good ol&rsquo; summer camp. To recapture that adventurous spirit, book the adult version: a learning vacation. Your days will include discovering new talents and building amazing connections. Consider these ideas&hellip;\r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Farm stay.** Feed horses, learn to make cheese, or stomp grapes, then join fellow farmhands to stargaze by night in a quiet rural setting. To find a US B&B, check [www.farmstay.com][1]. Or go abroad &mdash; search for &ldquo;agritourism&rdquo; and any country from Chile to New Zealand to explore authentic local culture. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Immersion.** Supercharge your foreign phrasebook by surrounding yourself with native speakers. You&rsquo;ll make unforgettable new friends as you learn a language, or even become part of your host&rsquo;s family if you choose a homestay in another country. In the US, several colleges and language [schools][2] offer summer programs.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Skills school.** Get back to basics at a folk school, where classes include sausage making, knitting, beekeeping, and woodworking. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      Make some new best buddies this season, while expanding your abilities and knowledge. \r\n\
