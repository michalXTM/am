Hi, I’m Blaine Beshah, the Global Merchant for Gap Fit, and I’m here 

2
00:00:07,176 --> 00:00:09,132
to talk to you guys about January.

3
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:12,826
This is a huge month for Fit, where our customer is making New Year’s 

4
00:00:12,826 --> 00:00:16,519
resolutions and she definitely needs a new workout wardrobe 

5
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:18,366
to help her get back in shape.

6
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:21,449
To help support our customer in her New Year’s resolutions, 

7
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:24,532
we have some great performance pieces in our January line.

8
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,981
We’re most excited about our marble prints, which are offered in tops, 

9
00:00:28,981 --> 00:00:33,432
bottoms, and sports bras, to inject a little bit of fashion into her outfit.

10
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,818
We’re also really excited about our Studio pieces, which are great 

11
00:00:36,818 --> 00:00:38,512
for wearing to and from the gym.

12
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,751
We have foam-bonded sweatshirts and bombers, that look really great 

13
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:44,992
paired over everything else that we offer in our Jan assortment.

14
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,547
Again, January is a very important month for Fit, with our customer 

15
00:00:48,547 --> 00:00:52,104
really looking to us to help her meet her New Year’s resolutions.

16
00:00:52,104 --> 00:00:56,201
By pushing the marble printed styles, as well as our Studio foam-bonded 

17
00:00:56,201 --> 00:01:00,299
pieces, you’ll help us drive great value and win the month of January.

18
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,400
Thank you.
